For the exam I use files exported from solidworks. 
Note: check the folder Auxiliars. 

Procedure:
                              Calculations of the pololu motor
 
To calculate  the max velocity I take from the datasheet the value of 290 RPM that belong of the 12 volts motor with high-power, 
and I convert it on rad/s, as shown below: 

    290 RPM to rad/s

    2pi
   ----- (290 RPM) = 30.36872898 rad/s
    60

To calculate  the max Torque I take from the datasheet the value of 120 oz-in that belong of the 12 volts motor with high-power, 
and I convert it on Nm, as shown below:

   120 oz-in to Nm

    1 Nm = 141.611928935736 oz-in

    (120 oz-in)(1 Nm)
   ------------------- =   0.84738624 Nm
  141.611928935736 oz-in

                                          Encoder 

To calculate  the resolution of the encoder I take from the datasheet the value of 1632.67 counts per revolution that belong of the 12 volts motor with high-power, and I convert it as shown below:

                     2pi
      Resolution =  -----  = 0.003848411073
                   1632.67


                                        lookuptable

  I take from the datasheet the value of 16 bits, and do the shown belog: 

     0       0    0                 2^(bit)-1 ==>     2^(16)-1 = 65535                
    0.2    65535  0


  The range of operation is from 0 to 200 mm.
